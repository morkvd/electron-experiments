  The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician
  John Horton Conway in 1970. It is the best-known example of a cellular automaton.
  Conway's game of life is described here:

  A cell C is represented by a 1 when alive or 0 when dead, in an m-by-m square array of cells.
  We calculate N - the sum of live cells in C's eight-location neighbourhood, then cell C is alive
  or dead in the next generation based on the following table:

    C   N                 new C
    1   0,1             ->  0  # Lonely
    1   4,5,6,7,8       ->  0  # Overcrowded
    1   2,3             ->  1  # Lives
    0   3               ->  1  # It takes three to give birth!
    0   0,1,2,4,5,6,7,8 ->  0  # Barren

  The "game" is actually a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its
  initial state, needing no input from human players. One interacts with the Game of Life by
  creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.
